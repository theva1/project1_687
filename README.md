# Project 1

## Topic
The relationship between computer usage and housing tenure in Maryland.

## Data
This project will use data from the Census ACS. More specifically, the "Computer and Internet Use", "Housing stock", and "Tenure" groups. 

## Transformations
None for collecting the ACS data. 

## Anaylsis
What is the relationship between computer and internet use and the ratio between owner-occupied and rent-occupied households in Maryland?

I will group tracts into quintiles based on the ratio of owner-occupied to renter-occupied households. Then I will attempt to answer the following questions:

How does the percentage of househoulds with no internet connection change throughout the quintiles?

Relative percentage of devices listed to access the interent per quintile (Desktop/laptops, cell phones, tablets, other) 

The same as above but for connectivity type (cellular, broadband, dial-up, satelite, and other). 


## Output
Maps showing the tracts based on owner-occupied to renter-occupied ratio, percentage of internet connected households. (And others!)

A table showing the analysis results from R. Quintiles of owner-occupied to renter-occupied households on the y axis and the relatve percentages regarding internet connectivity, device use , and type on the y axis. (e.g tracts less than 20% rent-occupied have x connectivity rate, list desktops y%, cellphones z%.. and so on) 

Then a write up summarizing results.
